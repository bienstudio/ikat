# To-do

- [ ] Make product photos square
- [ ] Fix product tiles (maybe not square and just use masonry?)
- [ ] Sidekiq set up (background file processing/upload, creating activities)
- [ ] Light API (basically adding to lists â€” whatever the bookmarklet needs)
- [ ] Bookmarklet
- [ ] Make removing IDs from models after ListItem deletion baked into ListItem callbacks, not in Product
- [ ] Trim whitespace around images
