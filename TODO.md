# To-do

- [ ] Make product photos square
- [ ] Fix product tiles
- [ ] Sidekiq set up (background file processing/upload, creating activities)
- [ ] Make join model for `List`:`Product` relationship for timestamps? (right now getting the `products` array from the model and reversing it — probably unreliable)
- [ ] Light API (basically adding to lists — whatever the bookmarklet needs)
- [ ] Bookmarklet
